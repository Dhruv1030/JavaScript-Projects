To-Do List App
A simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing or reopening the page.

Features
Add tasks: Add new tasks to the list.
Toggle completion: Click on a task to mark it as completed.
Delete tasks: Delete tasks by clicking the delete button.
Persistence: Tasks are saved in local storage, so they persist between page refreshes.
