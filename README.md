# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript-based projects designed to showcase a variety of core and advanced web development concepts. The projects demonstrate practical implementations of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, focusing on interactivity, functionality, and modern web practices.

## Projects Overview

Each folder or file in this repository represents an individual project. These projects encompass various aspects of JavaScript, from basic functionalities like to-do lists to more complex applications that integrate APIs and advanced DOM manipulation.

### Current Projects:
- **To-Do List App**: A simple interactive to-do list application where users can add, delete, and toggle tasks. The data is persistently stored in localStorage.


## Features

- **Interactive UIs**: Each project implements responsive, user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Local Storage**: Certain projects like the To-Do List app utilize the browser's localStorage to store data across sessions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Projects extensively demonstrate the manipulation of the DOM to create dynamic, interactive applications.
- **Event Handling**: Multiple event-driven features such as click, change, and hover events are implemented across projects.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and ensuring responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used to implement functionality.
- **LocalStorage**: For persisting user data in client-side applications.
- **APIs**: Some projects may demonstrate API usage (if applicable).
